## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
Thisn include sample functions available in package with examples of input and output for ease of use for other who will be using this once published.

This is R markdown for Wine data set

Challenges Faced:
We have to plan all functions will be included in packages in advance.
Solution:
During development of package we can update this Markdown file to include all function as we go on.
This file is created as a basic template which will be further updated as the development of package is completed.








```{r wine}
#loadData
Wine_data<- read.table("wine.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

## Including Plots
Plotting Alcohol consumption Deaths.

```{r Alcohol, echo=FALSE}
plot(Wine_data$alcohol, Wine_data$deaths, main = "Alcohol Consumption vs Deaths", xlab = "Alcohol Consumption", ylab = "Deaths")
```
